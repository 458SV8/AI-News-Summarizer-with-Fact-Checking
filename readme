AI News Summarizer with Fact-Checking

This project is a prototype that processes a news article, generates a concise summary using a transformer-based language model, extracts factual claims, and assigns simulated credibility scores to each claim.

Features
- Summarizes article content using Hugging Face's `bart-large-cnn` model
- Identifies claim-worthy sentences using keyword-based heuristics
- Simulates credibility scoring (High / Medium / Low) for each extracted claim
- Outputs a structured Markdown-style report containing the summary and claim assessments

Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Hugging Face Transformers
- NLTK (sentence tokenization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive development)

How to Use
1. Open the notebook `ai news summarizer prototype.ipynb`
2. Replace the sample article text with any news article of your choice
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:
   - Generate a summary
   - Extract factual claims
   - Assign simulated credibility scores
   - Print a structured report
